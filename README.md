## Introduction
Sequel2d is a high level OpenGL Core wrapper made to simplify stuff.
Made for people who are too lazy to learn or use OpenGL.
You should use GLAD/GLEW and GLFW or something to make it work

## History
One time way before sequel2d i started learning OpenGL,
of course i choosed Immediate OpenGL,
i started making a header called "Tfb2D"
Tfb2D stands for...- Transformation For Bit 2D.
and it was a mess.
No include guard, No implementation, snake_casePascalHybrid?
But still i did keep going,
Showing pranks and tests to my friends.
And a year later i started doing this header.
And because it's basically a remake of Tfb2D just kind of better,
I called it Sequel2d.
